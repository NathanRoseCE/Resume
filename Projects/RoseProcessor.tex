  \def\roseProcessorTasks {
    Increased the throughput of the processor by a factor of two by creating a two stage pipeline,
    Simplified the processorâ€™s IO operations by mapping IO operations to registers in the data memory,
    Designed and implemented a stack to increase the functionality of the board,
    Created a variable length opcode(fixed instruction size) in order to expand the number of operations that can be done without changing information
