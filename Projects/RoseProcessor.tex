    Increased the throughput of the processor by a factor of two by creating a three stage pipeline,
    Simplified the processorâ€™s IO operations by mapping IO operations to addresses in the data memory,
    Designed and implemented a increase the capabilities of the processor including implimentation of functions,
    Created a variable length opcode with fixed instruction size to expand the number of operations that can be performed
